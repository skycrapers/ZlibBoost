"""
SPICE deck generators for timing and power characterization.

This package contains generator classes used to create SPICE input decks
for various simulation types such as delay, leakage, constraints, minimum
pulse width (MPW), and hidden/dynamic power. Implementations follow a
common template defined in BaseSpiceGenerator.
